Confession time: I am a [blurker](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blurker){:target="blank"}. Worse than that, I rarely post anything of my own.
Perhaps It's time to change that.

This will be my little corner of the Internet to discuss various and sundry things. Some things which will probably be discussed include:

 * Web Development
 * Agile
 * My Family
 * Religion
 * Politics


Thanks for coming along for the ride. It'll probably be bumpy and at times feel like it's jumped the track. But... that's just the way it is.
